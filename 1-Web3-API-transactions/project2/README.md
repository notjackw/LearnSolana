# Project 2
This project does a simple SOL transfer between two wallets. The only difference between this and Project 1 is that we are not using the Solana playground. As a reminder, the playground automatically included a module ```pg``` that had several fields automatically initialized for us. ```connection``` was an instance of the web3.js API's Connection class that was connected to the devnet, and ```wallet``` was a keypair that was automatically airdropped SOL from the faucet. We do all of that manually here. Additionally, we use a local validator instead of the devnet just to make it a little bit harder.
